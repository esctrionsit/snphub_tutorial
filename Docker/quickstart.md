# Quick start

## Step.1

Clone (or download) project `snphub4docker` from github.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/esctrionsit/snphub4docker
```

## Step.2

Creat `Docker` image of `SnpHub`.

```sh
cd snphub4docker
sudo ./snphub creat image
```
Root permission is needed because of `Docker`.

## Step.3

Pre-process your own re-seq data.(Or **jump** this step if just want to try on our **sample** data.)

**Firstly**, you need to **fulfill** the `setup.conf`.
```sh
vi ./setup.conf
```
Put the needed files into a folder, and fulfill `setup_config.R` with their name and folder path.
An **template data folder** is provided at `snphub4docker/Template_data`.

**Then**, run command below to pre-process your data.

```sh
./snphub init -y
```

## Step.4

Now, you can try `SnpHub` by createing a container (instance), binding your host port with it, and mount your own data (if there is).

```sh
sudo ./snphub creat container -p 5123 -v /data/user_data
```

Options:
- `-p`: Dind the host port with container. A **random** port will be binded when **ignoring** this parameter.
- `-v`: Mount your own **pre-processed** re-seq data into container. `SnpHub` will run on a **sample data** when **ignoring** this parameter.

## Step.5

Open your browser, and enjoy at `http://localhost:5123`.

(Port is the one that you choose at step.4 or a random value. Check more details using `./snphub list`)
